🧠 Data Structure Visualizer
A Python desktop application built with Tkinter that lets users visualize common sorting algorithms and graph traversal algorithms step-by-step. Perfect for students, educators, and enthusiasts looking to better understand how these algorithms work under the hood.

🔍 Features
🎨 Intuitive GUI using Tkinter

🔁 Sorting algorithms (e.g., Bubble Sort, Merge Sort)

🌐 Graph traversal algorithms (e.g., BFS)

👇 Dropdown menus to select algorithm categories and specific algorithms

▶️ Run button to start visualizing the selected algorithm

📊 Real-time step-by-step visualization of algorithm execution

📸 Demo
(Include a GIF or screenshots here if you have them!)

Edit
python main.py
🛠️ Dependencies
Python 3.x

Tkinter (usually comes pre-installed with Python)

No external libraries required!

🧠 How It Works
The GUI presents two dropdowns:

Choose Algorithm Type: Select either "Sorting" or "Graph Traversal".

Choose Specific Algorithm: Based on the type selected, this dropdown updates to show available algorithms.

Click the "Run Visualization" button.

The algorithm runs step-by-step with a visual representation, helping you see exactly how it processes data.

📚 Algorithms Included
Sorting:
Bubble Sort

Selection Sort

Insertion Sort

Merge Sort

Quick Sort

Graph Traversal:
Breadth-First Search (BFS)
